# Mushroom-classification-project

**Inspiration behind the project -**  
I love eating mushrooms,but often when I buy them I am confused over the fact if they are eddible or not; even if I am buying them from a vegetable mart. The main reason behind this apprehension is the fact that I know there are multiple species of mushrooms out there; and some of them are edible and some of them are not.   
Hence the idea of a ML model came to my mind, which would be able to do this classification more efficiently than humans.  
And when i searched for a dataset to work on this problem, I found this dataset in Kaggle.  

**Problem Statement -**  
This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

**Goal of the prject -**  
We are required to model the different features of the given mushroom species and predict if a mushroom is 'edible' or 'poisonous'.

**Feature explanation -**
For undersanding the features of the dataset refer to the 'data dictionary' included in the repo.

**Libraries used for this project -**
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
